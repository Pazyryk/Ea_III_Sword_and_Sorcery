		<!-- Religions -->
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_THEISM_PEDIA">
			<Text>The Theistic worldview holds that there is a Creator outside of Éa that is Himself uncreated. Man's name for the Creator is Azzandara, and many civilizations of this race follow Azzandarayasna (the religion of Azzandara) to one degree or another. Although theists insist that there is only one God, their religious texts describe a second being in eternal opposition: Ahriman. Those who embrace Ahriman are few, and their religion, Aŋra, is greatly feared and reviled by most civilizations.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_PANTHEISM_PEDIA">
			<Text>The Pantheistic worldview holds that all things are part of divine existence. There is no separation between physical and spiritual and no Creator apart from Éa. All things - trees, rivers, and mountains; the Sun, Moon and stars; the elements; even a plague - have divine spirit and are gods in their own right. All pantheistic societies follow The Weave of Éa, which honors all incarnations, though some focus worship on a specific set, forming a cult within The Weave. These cults are narrowly focused and not always harmonious with each other.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_RELIGION_AZZANDARAYASNA_PEDIA">
			<Text>This is the religion of those that worship the Creator, Azzandara, whose followers are generally not tolerant of others that lack faith or hold other views (but reserve a special hatred for any Fallen civilization). Azzandarayasna is itself strengthened when any civilization adopts Theism policies (which add founder, follower and enhancer effects to the religion). Follower civilizations generate Paladins in place of the Warrior Great Person class, which learn and cast Divine spells in addition to acting as generals in war. Divine Liturgy and downstream techs make a variety of divine spells available for Priests and Paladins to learn. This is the only religion whose spellcasters use Divine Favor rather than Mana. Divine Favor is accumulated from a variety of sources, especially religious buildings, and is "tapped" by follower priests to cast spells related to healing, protection or the banishment of Aŋra and Sorcery.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_RELIGION_AZZANDARAYASNA_STRATEGY">
			<Text>Azzandarayasna is founded by the Prophecy of Ahuradhâta, which can be made by any Priest in a civilization that has opened the Theism policy branch (only available to civilizations of Man). It is spread by the Proselytize action available to Priests and Paladins.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_RELIGION_ANRA_PEDIA">
			<Text>This is the religion of those that worship the Anti-Creator, Ahriman, and embrace his destructive purpose. Civilizations that follow Aŋra are considered Fallen. Cities that have Aŋra as dominant religion have slowed growth, increased unhappiness and minor boosts to research and mana. The Founder of Aŋra gains significant research and mana based on the number of worldwide followers. Ahriman is said to be the instigator of all Sorcery, though most practitioners deny this link. All spellcasters in a Fallen civilization become, in effect, Sorcerers, with Priests and former Paladins (now Eidolons) consuming Mana in place of Divine Favor. Maleficium and downstream techs make a variety of spells available for these spellcasters that generally focus on destruction and corruption.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_RELIGION_ANRA_STRATEGY">
			<Text>Aŋra can be founded by the Prophecy of Aŋra, which can be made by any Devout in a civilization that has learned Maleficium. Alternatively, the religion may be founded indirectly if any civilization makes the Prophecy of Vâ. It is spread by the Proselytize action available to Priests and Eidolons.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_RELIGION_THE_WEAVE_OF_EA_PEDIA">
			<Text>This is the overarching religion of all pantheistic societies. It honors all of the spirits and incarnations of Éa and arises spontaneously in civilizations that have adopted Pantheism. It has no founder nor holy city. Bonuses are gained by adopting additional policies in the Pantheism branch, which generally enhance a follower's ability to subsist and thrive on the land and to gain benefit from Éa's wildlands. Although they appear as separate religions, all of the cults below are really sects within The Weave and retain follower effects of the mother religion in addition to cult-specific effects.</Text>

		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_EA_RELIGION_CULT_OF_LEAVES_STRATEGY">
