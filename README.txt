Welcome to the Ea III Sword & Sorcery mod!

Current mod version requires Ea Media Pack 20140305. You can
download that at:

THIS repository tracks changes in Lua, SQL, XML and some other
files included in the main (non-media) Modbuddy project. It
also includes the compiled CvGameCore_Ea.dll. This is the dll
that results from building the project in the Pazyryk/EaDLL
repository. I've included it here so that all files are present
that are needed to build Ea III, Sword and Sorcery (the non-
media mod).
